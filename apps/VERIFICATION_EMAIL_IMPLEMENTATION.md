## ðŸ“‹ Setup Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 2. Resend Account Setup

1. Sign up at [Resend.com](https://resend.com/) (free tier: 100 emails/day)
2. Create API key in dashboard
3. Add your domain and verify DNS records

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

### User Flow:

5. **Email Delivery**: Resend sends professional verification email
6. **User Notification**: User receives email with dashboard access link
7. **Admin Feedback**: Success message confirms email was sent

### Error Handling:
- If email fails, user verification still succeeds âœ…
- Admin sees specific error message âœ…
- Detailed logging for debugging âœ…
- No rollback of verification status âœ…
