  <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center py-16 px-6">
    <div className="w-24 h-24 bg-gray-100 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center mb-6">
      <PackageIcon size={48} className="text-gray-400" />
    </div>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">No products found</h3>
    <p className="text-gray-500 text-center mb-8 max-w-md">
      Start building your product catalog by adding your first product or importing from a catalog.
    </p>
    <div className="flex space-x-3">
      <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-md text-sm font-medium flex items-center hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors shadow-sm">
